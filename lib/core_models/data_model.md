## Core Models Structure

The data model is organized into several key areas:

1. **Trip Tracking**: Records individual journeys with detailed metrics
2. **Driving Data**: Captures OBD-II and phone sensor data during trips
3. **User Management**: Handles user profiles and preferences
4. **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes driving patterns and provides feedback
5. **Gamification**: Implements challenges, badges, and streaks to encourage engagement
6. **Social Features**: Enables social connections and content sharing
7. **Privacy Controls**: Manages user data privacy preferences
