### Day 17: Trip History Screen Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the trip history screen with search and filter functionality. Created four components: 1) SearchFilterBar for real-time trip searching, 2) TripListItem to display trip information with date, time, distance, eco-score and event indicators, 3) FilterSheet as a modal bottom sheet with date range picker, eco-score range slider, distance range slider, and event type checkboxes, and 4) the main TripHistoryScreen that coordinates all components and provides sorting controls. Implemented features include: trip grouping by date, infinite scrolling with lazy loading, comprehensive filtering options, real-time search, sorting by date/score/distance, elegant error states and empty states. The screen follows the design guidelines with clean separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation. Updated navigation to connect the insights dashboard to the trip history screen.

### Day 18: Trip Detail Screen Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the trip detail screen that displays comprehensive information about a specific trip. Created three main component files: TripMapSection for displaying a map visualization of the trip route (with a simulated route for demonstration), TripMetricsSection with tabbed interface showing performance metrics, efficiency data, and behavior analysis, and TripTimelineSection showing a chronological timeline of events during the trip. Added trip header with basic trip information, eco-score display, and key metrics. Implemented tabs for different views of the trip data. Added detailed metrics visualization, driving event summary, and performance analysis. Updated the app router to use the new TripDetailScreen component. Fixed linter issues for clean code. The implementation follows the design guidelines with proper separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation.
