## Research Foundation

Going50 is based on extensive research showing that individual driving behaviors significantly impact fuel consumption and emissions. Key findings include:

- Aggressive acceleration and braking can increase fuel consumption by up to 40%
- Maintaining speeds between 50-75 km/h (31-47 mph) maximizes efficiency for most vehicles
- Idling for more than 10-30 seconds uses more fuel than restarting the engine
- Optimal RPM (typically 1500-2500 RPM) can reduce fuel consumption by 20-25%
- Unnecessary stops dramatically increase fuel usage due to the energy required to accelerate from zero
