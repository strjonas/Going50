# Going50 Eco-Driving App: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step implementation guide for building the Going50 eco-driving application. Each step is designed to be completable within one day of focused development work, starting with core functionality and progressively adding features.

The implementation is organized into logical phases, with each phase building upon previous work. Some components like the OBD library, sensor library, and core models are already implemented and can be leveraged.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

### Day 1: Initial Project Setup & Structure ✅

**Summary**: Set up the project structure according to the architecture document. Added required dependencies in pubspec.yaml. Created the core architecture files: app.dart with theme implementation, main.dart, app_constants.dart with constants, app_colors.dart for color palette, and app_theme.dart with light and dark themes. Fixed integration issues with existing libraries (obd_lib, sensor_lib, data_lib) by adding missing dependencies and generating database code. The app now builds successfully with a basic UI showing the Going50 app name and tagline.



### Day 2: Service Locator & Core Utilities ✅

**Summary**: Implemented dependency injection using the get_it package with the service_locator.dart file to manage all service dependencies. Created core utilities in the utils directory: permission_utils.dart for handling different types of permissions needed for the app (Bluetooth, location, sensors), formatter_utils.dart for formatting various data types (dates, distances, fuel consumption, etc.), driving_utils.dart for eco-driving calculations (fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, aggressive driving detection, etc.), and device_utils.dart for detecting device capabilities (Bluetooth availability, battery status, etc.). All utilities are well-documented with comprehensive error handling and logging.


### Day 3: Navigation & Routing Infrastructure ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the navigation system and basic screen structure. Created route constants in route_constants.dart with well-organized route groups by feature area. Built a TabNavigator component that manages the bottom tab navigation with all four main tabs (Drive, Insights, Community, Profile). Implemented the app_router.dart file to handle named routes across the app, using MaterialPageRoute for consistent transitions. Created stub screen implementations for all main tabs with a clean, functional UI following the design guidelines. Updated the main App component to use the new TabNavigator and router. All screens include placeholders for core functionality and follow material design principles with proper documentation.

Updated the service locator to register the new service. The implementation follows the clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation.

### Day 5: Sensor Service Implementation & Integration ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the SensorService class as a facade to the sensor_lib, providing a clean interface for sensor data collection. Added methods for initialization, data collection, and error handling with appropriate permission checks. Modified the OBD connection service to include fallback functionality for when OBD connection is unavailable, allowing the app to collect driving data using phone sensors. Updated the service locator to properly register and inject dependencies. The implementation supports real-time sensor data streaming and seamless switching between OBD and sensor-only modes.


### Day 6: Data Collection Service Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the DataCollectionService that coordinates and combines data from both OBD and sensor sources. Created a clean, well-documented service that handles data merging, buffering, and processing. Implemented background collection capability to ensure continuous data flow even when the UI is not active. Added error handling, logging, and proper resource cleanup. Integrated with the EcoDrivingManager to feed combined data for analysis. The service exposes a stream of real-time combined driving data for other parts of the app to consume. Updated the service locator to register the new service, ensuring proper dependency injection. The implementation follows the clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.



### Day 7: Behavior Analysis Service Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the AnalyticsService that analyzes driving behavior using the behavior classifier library. Created a robust service with real-time analysis capabilities that calculates eco-scores, detects driving behavior events, and generates feedback suggestions. Implemented event detection for key driving behaviors with severity thresholds and confidence levels. Added feedback generation with prioritized improvement suggestions for different behavior categories. Set up real-time notifications through event streams for UI components. Integrated with the DataCollectionService to analyze collected driving data. Updated the service locator to properly connect services. The implementation includes clean error handling, efficient resource management, and comprehensive documentation.


### Day 8: Trip Management Service Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the TripService that interfaces with the DataStorageManager to manage trip recording and completion. Created functionality for starting and ending trips, calculating trip metrics (distance, speed, fuel consumption, etc.), and saving trip data points. Implemented real-time trip metrics updates through a stream for UI components to consume. Added event counting for different driving behaviors (idling, aggressive acceleration, hard braking, etc.). Integrated with the DataCollectionService to receive and process driving data points. Updated the service locator to register the new service and connect it with the DataCollectionService. The implementation includes robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and follows the clean architecture pattern with proper documentation.


### Day 9: Main Driving Service Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the DrivingService to act as a facade that coordinates all driving-related services. Improved the overall architecture by centralizing the orchestration of services, removing direct dependencies between subordinate services for better separation of concerns. Implemented proper state management for driving status (notReady, ready, recording, error). Created a unified interface for starting/stopping trips and accessing driving data. Added a driving event notification system that propagates events from all services through a single stream. Added methods for managing OBD device connections, scanning, and data collection. Set up proper error handling and resource disposal. Updated DataCollectionService to focus solely on data collection without dependencies on other services. Fixed issues in the ObdConnectionService to expose needed functionality. The implementation follows clean architecture principles with comprehensive documentation and robust error handling.

### Day 10: State Management & Provider Setup ✅

**Summary**: Implemented state management using providers for all major features. Created the DrivingProvider to expose driving-related functionality to the UI, including methods to start/end trips, scan for OBD devices, and access driving data and events. Implemented InsightsProvider to manage trip history and performance metrics with functionality for filtering, searching, and analyzing trip data. Added UserProvider to handle user profile information and preferences, with placeholder implementation for future user service integration. Implemented SocialProvider with mock data for friends and leaderboard features. Updated the App widget to use MultiProvider for providing all these services to the UI. All providers follow a consistent pattern with proper error handling, loading state management, and clean interfaces. The implementation ensures separation of concerns by keeping UI-related state in providers while delegating actual business logic to the services.


## Phase 3: Core UI Implementation (Week 3)

### Day 11: Common UI Components ✅

**Summary**: Implemented reusable UI components based on the design system. Created button components (PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton) with support for text, icons, and full-width variants. Implemented card components (InfoCard, StatsCard) for displaying information and statistics with consistent styling. Added a StatusIndicator component for showing different status types (success, warning, error, info, inactive) with appropriate styling. Created a SectionContainer layout helper for consistent spacing and organization of content sections with optional titles and dividers. All components follow the design guidelines, are highly reusable across the app, and include comprehensive documentation with usage examples. The implementation ensures consistent UI behavior and appearance throughout the app while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.

### Day 12: Onboarding Flow Implementation ✅

**Summary**: Implemented the complete onboarding flow for first-time users with a series of engaging and informative screens. Created the main OnboardingScreen wrapper that manages navigation between the different onboarding steps. Implemented WelcomeScreen with app introduction and value proposition. Built ValueCarouselScreen with a swipeable carousel showcasing key benefits (save money, reduce emissions, track progress). Created AccountChoiceScreen allowing users to choose between quick start (anonymous) or creating an account with clear benefits and limitations explained. Added ConnectionSetupScreen to guide users through OBD connection options with detailed explanations and visual aids. Updated the app to check for first-time use and show onboarding as needed using SharedPreferences. All screens follow the design guidelines with consistent styling, proper navigation, and comprehensive documentation. The implementation provides a smooth and informative introduction to the app for new users while allowing them to skip or navigate freely through the flow.
