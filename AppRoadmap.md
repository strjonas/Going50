# Going50 Eco-Driving App: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step implementation guide for building the Going50 eco-driving application. Each step is designed to be completable within one day of focused development work, starting with core functionality and progressively adding features.

The implementation is organized into logical phases, with each phase building upon previous work. Some components like the OBD library, sensor library, and core models are already implemented and can be leveraged.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

## Conclusion

This implementation guide provides a structured approach to building the Going50 eco-driving application over 8 weeks. Each day's tasks build upon previous work to create a fully-featured app that meets the requirements specified in the architecture, UI/UX, and requirements documents.

The implementation starts with core infrastructure, progresses through data collection and analysis, user interface implementation, and finally polishing and optimization. By following this guide, developers should be able to create a high-quality, feature-complete application that encourages sustainable driving behavior.

Remember that while each task is designed to be completable in a day, some complexity may require adjustments to the timeline. Regular communication among team members and adaptation based on progress is encouraged.
